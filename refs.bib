abstract = {Stochastic ecological and epidemiological models are now routinely used to inform management and decision making throughout conservation and public-health. A difficulty with the use of such models is the need to resort to simulation methods when the population size (and hence the size of the state space) becomes large, resulting in the need for a large amount of computation to achieve statistical confidence in results. Here we present two methods that allow evaluation of all quantities associated with one- (and higher) dimensional Markov processes with large state spaces. We illustrate these methods using SIS disease dynamics and studying species that are affected by catastrophic events. The methods allow the possibility of extending exact Markov methods to real-world problems, providing techniques for efficient parameterisation and subsequent analysis.}

abstract = {We demonstrate the strength of a general discrete-time modeling framework in which model specification is reduced to the bare essentials. The approach is due to Kermack and McKendrick, dating from 1927. Despite the many citations, the true contents of their work is essentially unknown. On top of that, their continuous-time model takes the mathematical form of a renewal equation, and only a few experts can handle such equations numerically. Here, we establish that the discrete-time version is equally general and flexible and, yet, is very simple to parametrize on the basis of data and to implement computationally. This makes the framework highly suitable for studying control scenarios for epidemic diseases such as COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to numerous mathematical models for the spread of infection, the majority of which are large compartmental models that implicitly constrain the generation-time distribution. On the other hand, the continuous-time Kermack–McKendrick epidemic model of 1927 (KM27) allows an arbitrary generation-time distribution, but it suffers from the drawback that its numerical implementation is rather cumbersome. Here, we introduce a discrete-time version of KM27 that is as general and flexible, and yet is very easy to implement computationally. Thus, it promises to become a very powerful tool for exploring control scenarios for specific infectious diseases such as COVID-19. To demonstrate this potential, we investigate numerically how the incidence-peak size depends on model ingredients. We find that, with the same reproduction number and the same initial growth rate, compartmental models systematically predict lower peak sizes than models in which the latent and the infectious period have fixed duration.}}

abstract = {We develop a new methodology for the efficient computation of epidemic final size distributions for a broad class of Markovian models. We exploit a particular representation of the stochastic epidemic process to derive a method which is both computationally efficient and numerically stable. The algorithms we present are also physically transparent and so allow us to extend this method from the basic SIR model to a model with a phase-type infectious period and another with waning immunity. The underlying theory is applicable to many Markovian models where we wish to efficiently calculate hitting probabilities.}
